# SushiMee Website

This is the Readme.md for the SushiMee website, a project built following the [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery)'s  tutorial on YouTube. 

## Description

SushiMee is a website (likely a single-page application) built using mostly html and css. I also using javascript library AOS (Animate On Scroll) for making this website
interactive. 

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

    Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Running the application locally:

    Clone this repository.
    Install required dependencies using npm install (or your preferred package manager).
    Run the development server using npm run dev (or the equivalent command based on the tutorial).
    Open http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port) in your web browser.

## Deployment

This section will depend on the deployment method you choose. Personally, i use [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) because it linked with github and easier to deploy projects.

    If you use vercel, here is the steps: 
    1) Upload Sushi project to github
    2) Make sure you have already vercel account. Then, at vercel projects, click "add new". 
    4) You will be redirected to the GitHub folders where you will select the project you want to deploy, in this case "Sushi Project" 
    5) Deploy the project, and wait until it done. 

## Usage

    This website is for sushi restaurant. This website let people check information about Sushimee contain of menus, services, and restaurant information.
